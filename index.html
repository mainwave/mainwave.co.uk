					<h2>In a nutshell</h2>
					<p>
						Working directly with customers, with no risk and lots of flexibility, Mainwave is a proud pioneer of
						freelance software services fit for the 21st century.
					</p>

					<div id="nutshell-no-agents" class="subsection">
						<h3>No agencies, no hassle</h3>
						<p>
							I&rsquo;ve been freelance since 2005 and have never had to rely on agencies to find work.
							I&rsquo;ve managed it by direct networking and building great customer relationships that lead to
							repeat work and <a class="local meta" href="#testimonials">glowing recommendations</a>.
							It&rsquo;s been very refreshing &ndash; a simpler, clearer, better way of working.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div id="nutshell-no-risk" class="subsection">
						<h3>No risk</h3>
						<p>
							Resourcing a project can be difficult, and the impact of appointing the wrong person with the wrong
							skills can be catastrophic. That&rsquo;s why I offer you a risk-free phase, written into our contract,
							that guarantees you pay nothing if you&rsquo;re not 100% happy with my work. This means I own the
							resourcing risk, not you. And I never claim to have skills I don&rsquo;t, or massage my CV to match
							the job spec.
						</p>
						<p>
							Don&rsquo;t you wish all contractors worked that way?
						</p>
					</div>

					<div id="nutshell-flexible" class="subsection">
						<h3>Super flexible</h3>
						<p>
							As I work directly with you, I&rsquo;m not restricted to the typical 6- or 12-month blocks favoured by agencies.
							I&rsquo;m happy committing to you for just a few days or weeks while your project gets off the ground or
							you&rsquo;re waiting for long-term budget approval. And when the project takes off, I&rsquo;ll be happy to
							extend on an ad-hoc basis to help you see it through to a successful delivery.

					<h2>Mobile</h2>
					<p>
						Much of my professional life has centred around mobile software development.
						I&rsquo;ve worked on just about everything, from apps through embedded software and
						operating system components all the way down to device drivers.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span id="android-logo"></span>
						Most recently I&rsquo;ve been working on a diverse range of <strong>Android</strong>
						projects. I&rsquo;ve worked as lead Android developer on a Mobile Device Management (MDM)
						solution, where I also implemented <a class="local services" href="#dot-net">C#/.NET</a> server-side
						components. Before that I was a lead developer on
						a team developing a bespoke, touch-driven, full HD user interface and device drivers for
						an audio mixing console running a custom build of Android. I also developed an Android
						version of the popular Guardian Eyewitness iPad app which I sold to the Guardian in 2012.
					</p>
					<p>
						I&rsquo;ve also worked on more niche platforms, developing a suite of apps (including
						Reuters News Pro, Sainsbury&rsquo;s and Audioboo) for <strong>Nokia</strong> developed
						in C++ using Qt, and calendar and time-zone OS components for the <strong>MeeGo</strong>
						platform.
					</p>
					<p>
						My mobile work stretches right back to my early days in the industry, when I spent many
						years writing SymbianOS software in C++ for clients including Nokia, Fujitsu, Motorola,
						Siemens and Symbian. In 1999 I was part of the UK team working on the
						<a target="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ericsson_R380">Ericsson R380</a>
						&ndash; the world&rsquo;s first smartphone.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, I&rsquo;ve also developed server-based mobile systems that interact with the
						phone via SMS and mobile web content. For more detail on how those were developed, head
						over to the <a class="local services" href="#dot-net">C# and .NET</a> section.
					</p>

					<h2>C# and .NET <small>and related Microsoft technologies</small></h2>
					<p>
						I&rsquo;ve designed, built and deployed large-scale, data-driven systems using
						<strong>C#</strong>, <strong>.NET</strong>, <strong>SQL Server</strong>,
						<strong>Entity Framework</strong>, <strong>ASP.NET</strong>, <strong>MVC</strong>,
						<strong>Web API</strong> and <strong>Windows services</strong>.

						I&rsquo;ve built systems hosted on-premises as well as on <strong>Azure</strong> and <strong>AWS</strong>.

						Most of the systems I&rsquo;ve built have had a mobile component too, with either
						a separate mobile-specific user interface or a full set of web services to support
						native mobile clients.
					</p>
					<p>
						The major solutions I&rsquo;ve delivered to date include:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Websites, management portals and mobile app APIs for a popular recruitment app
						</li>
						<li>
							All server-side components for a Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution for iOS,
							Android and Windows Phone
						</li>
						<li>
							Back-end services for a major UK utility provider&rsquo;s website
						</li>
						<li>
							A system powering mobile marketing campaigns, enabling sophisticated customer
							interaction and CRM features via any mobile phone using SMS, e-mail and mobile web
							content
						</li>
						<li>
							A workflow management system for the education sector, allowing users from different
							organisations and sites to manage and track business processes, share and
							collaboratively edit forms and documents, and manage their users and affiliated
							organisations
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						In delivering these and other systems I&rsquo;ve designed and implemented all of the
						following:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Large relational data schemas
						</li>
						<li>
							SQL Server data access layer using both T-SQL stored procedures and Entity Framework
						</li>
						<li>
							Class libraries and Windows services using C#, .NET and MSMQ
						</li>
						<li>
							JSON and SOAP web services using ASP.NET Web API and WCF
						</li>
						<li>
							Web-based user interfaces using ASP.NET and MVC, complemented with standard open
							<a class="local services" href="#web">web technologies</a>

					<h2>Web apps</h2>
					<p>
						I build web apps for desktop, tablets and phones using <strong>HTML5</strong>,
						<strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong> and standard reusable frameworks
						like <strong>jQuery</strong> and <strong>Modernizr</strong>. For back-end development
						I&rsquo;m particularly experienced in <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>Perl</strong>.
						Modern open web technologies certainly aren&rsquo;t just for web sites: they&rsquo;re
						an excellent platform for delivering capable, responsive, multi-platform applications
						with short development times.
					</p>
					<div class="gallery js-only desktop-only" id="book-reader-gallery" title="Click to view the gallery">
						<p class="title">HTML5 book reader</p>
						<p class="subtitle">View the gallery</p>
					</div>
					<p>
						My biggest HTML5 project to date is a fully-featured <strong>book reader for iPad and
						Android tablets</strong>. Unfortunately it&rsquo;s a private system so I can&rsquo;t
						publish a link<span class="js-only desktop-only">, but you can see some screenshots in the
						gallery</span>.
					</p>
					<p>
						It boasts all the features you&rsquo;d expect to find in a book reader: multi-title
						bookshelf, bookmarking, sticky notes, text highlighting, offline reading and more.
						It also has features you might only expect to find in a native application, such as
						localisation and a full multi-touch UI for tablets.
					</p>
					<p>
						Implementing it involved using lots of new web technologies such as:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							HTML5 <a target="external" href="http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html#localstorage">local
							storage</a>

					<h2>About Mainwave</h2>
					<p>
						<span id="mark-photo"></span>
						Mainwave was founded by <strong>Mark Whitaker</strong> in 2005 and is based in
						Manchester, UK.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have worked in the software industry for over 15 years in a variety of companies
						and roles. Before founding Mainwave I was Vice President of a software house in
						Manchester where I managed large projects for major international clients such as
						Nokia, Disney and Avaya.
					</p>
					<p>
						I&rsquo;ve also worked with much smaller companies, right down to one-man bands.
						I&rsquo;ve experienced the growing pains that organisations of all sizes go through
						as they enter new phases of their development.
					</p>
					<p>
						Before working in project management, I was a software engineer and technical consultant
						for many years. I have designed and written software for all sorts of devices, from
						phones to servers, and have delivered training courses and conference papers worldwide.
					</p>
					<p>
						I hold an <abbr title="Master of Science">MSc</abbr> in Computing Science from Newcastle
						University, as well as a 1st Class <abbr title="Bachelor of Arts">BA</abbr> (Hons) in
						German and Management Studies from the University of Leeds and an
						<abbr title="Master of Letters">MLitt</abbr> in German Studies from Newcastle.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>I founded Mainwave on core principles of quality, honesty and trust.</strong>
						Everything I do is carried out to the highest standards, with the key aim of improving
						the quality and efficiency of your business. I communicate clearly, from the very
						first point of contact, so that my dealings with you are always well understood and
						agreed. My goal is to build trusting, long-term relationships that truly benefit all
						involved.

					<h2>What my clients say</h2>

					<div class="subsection">
						<p>
							Mark was brought in as a heavyweight developer with an excellent reputation (which he lived up to).
							I was impressed by his professionalism, attention to detail, competence and productivity.
							He was highly effective and had a strong positive influence upon the project.
						</p>
						<p class="author">Louis Mehr, Product Manager, <a target="external" href="http://calrec.com/">Calrec Audio</a></p>
					</div>

					<div class="subsection">
						<p>
							We&rsquo;ve always valued Mark as a safe pair of hands who can take ownership of a task or project
							and be trusted to deliver it to our complete satisfaction. He has a real attention to detail,
							understands the full scope of an assignment without missing peripheral issues and spots potential
							problems well in advance. As a result the work he produces is always of the highest quality.
						</p>
						<p class="author">Jim Carroll, CTO, <a target="external" href="http://www.mobica.com/">Mobica</a></p>
					</div>

					<div class="subsection">
						<p>
							Mark joined a project team at Mando to help us deliver a major upgrade to a large client&rsquo;s web
							platform. His work was of an impressively high standard from the start, and his flexibility was a
							great asset as the project ebbed and flowed. I&rsquo;d be more than happy to work with Mark again
							or recommend him to others.
						</p>
						<p class="author">Ian Finch, Managing Director and Founder, <a target="external" href="http://www.mandogroup.com/">Mando Group</a></p>
					</div>

					<div class="subsection">
						<p>
							Mark was helpful in mentoring some of our more junior developers, showing them ways in which they
							can improve their skills. He is good at taking direction and is not afraid to ask pertinent
							questions. In short, if you are looking for a strong all-round technical lead or lead developer,
							you do not need to look any further than this man &ndash; I would have no hesitation in recommending him.
